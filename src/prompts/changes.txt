USER PROMPT:
Original User Request: "{}"

Full Context (previously provided and confirmed sufficient):
```
{}
```
{}
Instruction:
Generate the necessary code modifications.
{}
Your response MUST be a single JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "changes": [
    {{
      "file_path": "src/path/to/file.rs",
      "action": "ReplaceContent", // or "CreateFile", "DeleteFile" (More granular actions like ApplyDiff, ReplaceLines are harder to implement client-side, prefer ReplaceContent if unsure)
      "content": "..." // Full new content for 'ReplaceContent' or 'CreateFile'. Null for 'DeleteFile'.
    }}
  ],
  "tests": [ // Only include if tests are requested. Omit or empty array if not.
    {{
      "file_path": "src/path/to/test_file.rs", // Or a new tests/test_file.rs
      "action": "append_to_file", // or "create_file"
      "content": "...", // Test function(s) code
      "test_name": "test_my_new_feature" // Optional
    }}
  ],
  "explanation": "A brief summary of the changes made and why."
}}
Ensure the 'content' for code is properly escaped for JSON. For "ReplaceContent", provide the ENTIRE new file content.
